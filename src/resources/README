To generate another resources.c file from a glade file,
name the glade file "financials.glade" and replace that file 
in this folder.

Then run this command in this folder:

glib-compile-resources --generate-source resources.xml

-------------
The glade file isn't necessary to compile, but it would be rather 
difficult for anyone to alter the appearance without it here.

"/financials.glade" is the reference to the UI resource in the 
GResources namespace, but is not a reference to a file, only the 
GUI description which is defined in a binary format within resources.c

The icon file is already referenced from the glade file and defined
in binary format from resources.c.  So basically referenced and stored
in binary format from resources.c.
